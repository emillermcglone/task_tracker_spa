#Design 
The user starts at a log in page where they can log in or make a new account. Emails for new accounts must have an "@" and no duplicate emails are allowed. If they make a new account,
the user must reload the page before they can log into the task tracker. 

Users can create new tasks, edit tasks, and delete tasks. When setting the time for a task, only increments of 15 will be allowed. User's can view the other user accounts by clicking "Users" in the 
header. They can switch back to the tasks page by clocking "Task Tracker" in the header. 

Once finished, they can log out.
